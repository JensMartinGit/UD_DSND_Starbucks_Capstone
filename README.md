# Predicting Customer Response on Starbucks Promotional Offers 
### Detailed Walk-Through of a Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project using Supervised Machine Learning with Python, Pandas and Scikit-learn

This project was developed as part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. It is based on data from a **simulated customer** test provided by **Starbucks**. The data set depicts how customers make **purchasing decisions** and how these decisions are **influenced by promotional offers**. While the task for this project is not exactly prescribed, my approach is to use the data to **build a supervised machine learning model** that - based on demographic customer data and offer features -  **predicts customer response** on different types of promotional offers.

The results are presented in a blog post on Medium.
